  "Creative Non-Fiction|Elements of Creative Non-Fiction|Understanding the Personal Essay": [
    { title: "What Is the Personal Essay?", content: "<p>The personal essay is a short piece of nonfiction that explores an idea, memory, or experience from the writer's own life. It combines <strong>reflection</strong> with <strong>narrative</strong> and often has a conversational tone.</p>" },
    { title: "Key Features", content: "<ul><li><strong>First-person voice</strong> — The writer speaks directly to the reader.</li><li><strong>Narrow focus</strong> — One main idea or experience, explored in depth.</li><li><strong>Reflection</strong> — The writer draws meaning or insight from the experience.</li><li><strong>Authenticity</strong> — Honest, genuine perspective.</li></ul>" },
    { title: "Why It Matters", content: "<p>Personal essays help readers connect with universal themes through one person's story. They are used in magazines, blogs, and academic settings to share ideas in an engaging, accessible way.</p>" }
  ],
  "Creative Non-Fiction|Elements of Creative Non-Fiction|Memoir and Autobiography": [
    { title: "Memoir vs. Autobiography", content: "<p><strong>Autobiography</strong> typically covers the author's whole life in chronological order. <strong>Memoir</strong> focuses on a specific period, theme, or set of experiences—not necessarily the full life story.</p>" },
    { title: "Elements of Memoir", content: "<ul><li>Selective memory — Choosing which events to include.</li><li>Emotional truth — Honesty about feelings and impact.</li><li>Scene and reflection — Showing moments and then reflecting on them.</li><li>Voice — A distinct, consistent narrative voice.</li></ul>" },
    { title: "Writing Tip", content: "<p>Start with one vivid scene or moment. Build outward from that moment rather than trying to tell everything at once.</p>" }
  ],
  "Creative Non-Fiction|Elements of Creative Non-Fiction|Literary Journalism": [
    { title: "What Is Literary Journalism?", content: "<p>Literary journalism (also called narrative journalism or creative nonfiction reportage) uses the <strong>techniques of fiction</strong>—scene, dialogue, character—to tell <strong>true stories</strong> based on research and reporting.</p>" },
    { title: "Key Techniques", content: "<ul><li>Scene-building and vivid detail</li><li>Dialogue and real quotes</li><li>Character development of real people</li><li>Factual accuracy with engaging narrative</li></ul>" },
    { title: "Purpose", content: "<p>It aims to inform and engage readers by making real events as compelling as fiction while staying faithful to the facts.</p>" }
  ],
  "Creative Non-Fiction|Techniques in Creative Non-Fiction|Scene and Summary": [
    { title: "Scene vs. Summary", content: "<p><strong>Scene</strong> shows a moment in real time—dialogue, action, sensory detail. <strong>Summary</strong> compresses time and tells what happened in a few sentences. Good creative nonfiction <strong>balances both</strong>.</p>" },
    { title: "When to Use Each", content: "<ul><li>Use <strong>scene</strong> for key moments: turning points, conflict, emotion.</li><li>Use <strong>summary</strong> to move quickly through less important time or background.</li></ul>" },
    { title: "Practice", content: "<p>Take one event from your life. Write one paragraph as pure scene (dialogue and action), then one as summary. Notice how each affects pace and impact.</p>" }
  ],
  "Creative Non-Fiction|Techniques in Creative Non-Fiction|Voice and Point of View": [
    { title: "Voice in Creative Nonfiction", content: "<p>Voice is the personality and style of the narrator—your writing “sounds” like you. It includes word choice, sentence rhythm, tone (serious, humorous, reflective), and attitude.</p>" },
    { title: "Point of View", content: "<p>Most creative nonfiction uses <strong>first person</strong> (I, we) because the writer is part of the story. First person builds intimacy and allows reflection. Consistency in POV keeps the reader oriented.</p>" },
    { title: "Finding Your Voice", content: "<p>Write as if speaking to a thoughtful friend. Read your draft aloud; adjust until it sounds natural and true to your experience.</p>" }
  ],
  "Creative Non-Fiction|Techniques in Creative Non-Fiction|Fact and Imagination": [
    { title: "The Line Between Fact and Imagination", content: "<p>Creative nonfiction is grounded in <strong>fact</strong>—real events, people, and places. Writers may use <strong>reconstruction</strong> (filling in likely details from research or memory) but must not invent major events or dialogue that did not occur.</p>" },
    { title: "Ethical Guidelines", content: "<ul><li>Do not invent quotes or key events.</li><li>Use composite characters or changed names only with clear disclosure if needed.</li><li>When memory is uncertain, say so.</li></ul>" },

  ],

  "Creative Writing|Foundations of Creative Writing|Imagery and Sensory Detail": [
    { title: "What Is Imagery?", content: "<p>Imagery is language that appeals to the <strong>senses</strong>—sight, sound, touch, taste, smell. It helps readers experience the story rather than only being told about it.</p>" },
    { title: "Using Sensory Detail", content: "<ul><li>Show, don’t tell — Instead of “She was sad,” show her actions and surroundings.</li><li>Use specific, concrete details rather than vague ones.</li><li>Mix senses — Don’t rely only on visual description.</li></ul>" },

  ],
  "Creative Writing|Foundations of Creative Writing|Character Development": [
    { title: "What Makes a Character Feel Real?", content: "<p>Readers connect to characters who have <strong>goals</strong>, <strong>flaws</strong>, and <strong>change</strong>. Character development is how you reveal these through action, dialogue, and reflection.</p>" },
    { title: "Ways to Develop Character", content: "<ul><li>Actions and choices under pressure</li><li>Dialogue that reveals personality</li><li>Inner thoughts and feelings</li><li>How others react to the character</li></ul>" },
    { title: "Tip", content: "<p>Give your character a want and an obstacle. The conflict between them drives the story and reveals who the character is.</p>" }
  ],
  "Creative Writing|Foundations of Creative Writing|Plot and Structure": [
    { title: "What Is Plot?", content: "<p>Plot is the sequence of events in a story and the <strong>cause-and-effect</strong> links between them. Structure is how you arrange those events (chronological, flashback, parallel storylines).</p>" },
    { title: "Basic Structure", content: "<ul><li><strong>Exposition</strong> — Setup, world, and characters.</li><li><strong>Rising action</strong> — Conflict and complications.</li><li><strong>Climax</strong> — Turning point or peak tension.</li><li><strong>Falling action / Resolution</strong> — Aftermath and closure.</li></ul>" },

  ],
  "Creative Writing|Genres and Forms|Short Fiction": [
    { title: "What Is Short Fiction?", content: "<p>Short fiction includes <strong>short stories</strong> and <strong>flash fiction</strong>. Length can range from a few hundred words (flash) to several thousand. Every word must earn its place.</p>" },
    { title: "Characteristics", content: "<ul><li>Limited number of characters and settings</li><li>One main conflict or idea</li><li>Strong opening and satisfying ending</li><li>Suggestiveness — leave room for the reader to imagine</li></ul>" },
    { title: "Advice", content: "<p>Start close to the conflict. End at a moment of change or revelation, not necessarily a tidy resolution.</p>" }
  ],
  "Creative Writing|Genres and Forms|Poetry Basics": [
    { title: "What Makes Poetry?", content: "<p>Poetry uses <strong>line breaks</strong>, <strong>sound</strong> (rhythm, rhyme, repetition), and <strong>compressed language</strong> to create meaning and emotion. It can be formal or free verse.</p>" },
    { title: "Key Elements", content: "<ul><li>Imagery and metaphor</li><li>Sound: rhythm, rhyme, alliteration</li><li>Line and stanza (structure on the page)</li><li>White space and silence</li></ul>" },
    { title: "Getting Started", content: "<p>Read poems aloud. Notice how line breaks and word choice create emphasis and feeling. Try writing one image or one moment in few words.</p>" }
  ],
  "Creative Writing|Genres and Forms|Writing for Different Audiences": [
    { title: "Why Audience Matters", content: "<p>Your <strong>audience</strong> affects tone, vocabulary, what you explain, and what you assume they already know. The same topic can be written for children, experts, or the general public in very different ways.</p>" },
    { title: "Questions to Ask", content: "<ul><li>Who will read this? Age, interests, background?</li><li>What do they already know? What do they need to learn?</li><li>What tone do they expect—formal, casual, playful?</li></ul>" },
    { title: "Practice", content: "<p>Take one idea and write two short versions: one for a peer, one for a younger or non-expert reader. Notice how you change language and examples.</p>" }

    { title: "What Is a Thesis Statement?", content: "<p>A <strong>thesis statement</strong> is one or two sentences that state your main argument or claim. It appears usually in the introduction and guides the rest of the paper. It should be <strong>specific</strong>, <strong>debatable</strong>, and <strong>supportable</strong>.</p>" },
    { title: "Outlining", content: "<p>An outline organizes your ideas before you write. Use headings and subheadings for main points and supporting details. This keeps your logic clear and helps you avoid repetition or missing evidence.</p>" },

    { title: "Common Styles", content: "<p><strong>APA</strong> (American Psychological Association) and <strong>MLA</strong> (Modern Language Association) are two widely used formats. Follow your instructor’s or publisher’s required style consistently.</p>" },

  "Oral Communication|Principles of Effective Speaking|Audience Analysis": [

    { title: "Critical Analysis", content: "<p>Critical analysis means <strong>evaluating</strong> a text—its argument, evidence, assumptions, and effectiveness. Ask: Is the reasoning sound? Is the evidence sufficient? What is left out? What is the author’s purpose?</p>" },

  ],
  "Reading and Writing Skills|Effective Writing|Coherence and Cohesion": [
    { title: "Coherence", content: "<p><strong>Coherence</strong> means your writing is <strong>logically organized</strong> and easy to follow. Ideas flow in an order that makes sense, and each sentence connects to the next.</p>" },
    { title: "Cohesion", content: "<p><strong>Cohesion</strong> is the use of <strong>linking words and repetition</strong> to tie sentences and paragraphs together. Transitions (however, for example, in addition), pronouns, and repeated key terms help readers see relationships.</p>" },

  ],
  "Reading and Writing Skills|Effective Writing|Revision and Editing": [
    { title: "Revision vs. Editing", content: "<p><strong>Revision</strong> focuses on content and structure: ideas, organization, and clarity. <strong>Editing</strong> focuses on sentence-level issues: grammar, punctuation, word choice, and style. Do revision first, then editing.</p>" },
    { title: "Revision Questions", content: "<ul><li>Is my main point clear? Is anything missing or unnecessary?</li><li>Is the order of ideas effective?</li><li>Does each paragraph support the main idea?</li></ul>" },
    { title: "Editing", content: "<p>Check for run-ons, fragments, agreement, and punctuation. Use a spell-checker and read the paper one more time slowly. Another reader can often spot what you miss.</p>" }
